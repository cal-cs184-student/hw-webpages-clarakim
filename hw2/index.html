		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive subdivision method for evaluating points on a Bezier curve, by
		continuously inserting points between control points using linear interpolation, until a single (final)
		point on the curve is reached. <br>
		Based on the given parameter of control points, I perform one step of the recursion in this evaluateStep() function,
		taking two points at a time and using the formula <br>\( P'i = (1-t) * points[i] + t * points[i+1] \)</li><br>
		to compute the intermediate points (between the two given points)
		for the next level of subdivision, storing them in the new nPoints vector and returning it.
		<br>
		I was confused because although I could adjust t with scrolling, I couldn't get different Bezier curves to appear because I couldn't change the control points,
		but implementing the fix from Ed fixed the issue.

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		For a Bezier surface, each surface point is defined with (u, v). The de Casteljau algorithm is used 
		to first used to evaluate point u on each of the Bezier curves in the u dimension (each row of control points), to reduce the 2D
		grid to a 1D array of intermediate points. This was done by calling evaluate1D() for each row with u, inside
		evaluate() function. Then, inside evaluate1D(), evaluateStep() is called repeatedly until 1 final point remains,
		which is stored inside the rowPoints inside evaluate() function. Finally, evaluate1D() is called again with rowPoints and v, 
		to get a final point on the overall Bezier surface.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		In order to compute the area-weighted normal at a given vertex, I had to use the half-edge data Structure to iterate through
		faces (neighboring triangles), weighting each face's normal by its area and then normalizing.
		I first computed the position of the 3 vertices of a triangle by starting at the current halfedge's vertex, then using next to 
		traverse through all the vertices; then, I used the positions of the vertices to compute the edge vectors connected to the initial v0 vertex of the triangle.
		I found the cross product of the 2 edges (e3_perp), and then found the area of the triangle
		with 0.5 * the normal of the cross product. After I weighed the area by the e3_perp, continuously accumulated the weighted normals in areaWeightedNormals vector.

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		I implemented edge flip by first drawing the figure shown in the spec, labeling the half edges h0 and h1 based on the edge in the middle,
		and then labeling the rest of the 4 half edges. I also labeled the 4 vertices, as well as the 2 faces (left-f0 and right-f1). I made sure that
		I was labeling/accessing each of these variables correctly with my code, by correctly traversing through the half edges, vertices, faces, and twins.
		<br>
		Then, I drew another figure on my tablet with the middle edge flipped, maintaining the initial vertices labels and just changing h0 and h1, and
		the appropriate faces labels. Afterwards, I used setNeighbors to reassign each of the 6 half edges on my code,
		identifying appropriate next() half edges, twins, edges, and vertices for the half edges.
		<br><br>
		I initially got started with the code right away and attempted to just do the whole process with my code, but I got confused with the assignments very quickly,
		and using my tablet and drawing out everything made the entire process much smoother. My debugging journey was not too eventful, but I had to make sure I was also
		reassigning vertices and faces other than the half edges as well. When my edge wasn't flipping initially, it was also painful to figure out what part was missing/incorrect,
		so the only way was to read through my code and make thorough comparisons with my drawing.

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		Similary with the previous part, I started off by drawing my diagram and labeling all the initial half edges, vertices, and half edges (copied from part 4).
		Starting with the initial diagram with 1 vertical edge through the center, I made sure to draw another edge connecting the remaining 2 edges and crossing through the
		midpoint (calculated based on v0 and v1's position) and split up the half edges and edges.
		<br>
		The entire implementation was not too difficult because I got used to the assignments and traversal methods from previous parts, but since the diagram became
		much more complex with total of 12 half edges, 4 faces, 4 edges (inside), and 5 vertices (including m), I had to make sure I was being very careful with my assignments.
		Selecting and assigning half edges for the vertices was bit confusing, and the process of determining if I would need to identify/work with 12 half edges or not
		was also another part that took some experimentation.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		For Loop subdivision, I generally followed the comments/directions on the spec, first computing the new vertex positions using the provided formula, 
		using the v->isNew flag to mark vertices as part of the original mesh. Then, I stored the original edges (before splitting), iterating through them and
		also updating the new positions and the e->isNew = false.
		<br>
		The next part, split edge, I thought was also pretty straightforward but when I encountered various cube shapes at the rendering stage, I found out that this 
		was where my problems were caused. I checked through the logic of other sections of the code multiple times, and could not find wrong areas, and also tried setting
		isNew flags from splitEdge and flipEdge functions although I knew from previous sanity checks that these sections were working fine, and I was already setting those flags
		inside loops in the upsample function. However, my cube stayed deformed in multiple different ways, and caused me enormous pain. This was when I decided to revert back to my 
		table drawing from splitEdge (task 5), and verify which edges were being marked as isNew = true. This was where I found my error, and when I fixed it, the cube looked like it was supposed to.
		<br>
		After the step 3: split, in split 4: flip, I followed the directions and only flipped edges that connected an old and new vertex, by checking the v->isNew flags. At the end, I
		iterated through all the vertex positions and updated based on the new positions calculated from previous functions.
		<br><br>
		Some observations I noticed after loop subdivision is that the sharp corners and edges become smoother, and the cube becomes 'rounder' after each iteration. This can be reduced by
		pre-splitting some edges, so each edge around sharp corners would be averaged more frequently and be weighted less, preserving the sharpness around individual edges.
		<br>
		Since the cube vertices have different degrees (i.e. 3 vs 4), subdivision creates asymmetry as it gets divided with different weights. Different ways to pre-process the cube
		in order to ensure more symmetric subdivision exists, such as flipping edges to create more regular/uniformly shaped triangles, and splitting edges to make the vertices have more
		equal number of degree and connectivity. Since the new positions of vertices are calculated based on the vertex degree counts and the new edge positions are calculated based on 
		initial edge positions, these pre-processing changes would ensure more even subdivision of triangles.
